# HackWeek 20

My goal for this year HackWeek is to get familiar with Smalltalk.

To put in practice what I am learning, I plan to solve the problems
from 22th to 26th of https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021
using Smalltalk.

## Note for Smalltalk developers
The code has been written by an absolutely newbie in Smalltalk.
